### Intro

Nessus creates a native file called nessus.db file when generating scan reports.

These scan reports are manually downloadable from the Nessus GUI and are also exposed by the Nessus REST API.   

This ```py-nessus-wrapper``` makes use of [metaevolution/py-nessus](https://github.com/metaevolution/py-nessus)
